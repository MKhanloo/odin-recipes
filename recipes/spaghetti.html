    <h2>How to Make the Best Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>For this spaghetti, we turn to our favorite quick meat sauce recipe.
         It’s made using one-pot, is ultra flavorful, and can be made in under
          45 minutes. The spaghetti sauce is also perfect for making ahead.
           It can be refrigerated for up to three days and stored in your
            freezer for about three months. </p>
